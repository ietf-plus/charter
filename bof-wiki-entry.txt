- Name: PLUS (Path Layer UDP Substrate)

- Description: The PLUS working group's goal is to enable the deployment of new, encrypted transport protocols, while providing a transport-independent method to signal flow semantics under transport and application control. The approach from which the working group will start is a shim layer based on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides compatibility with existing middleboxes in the Internet as well as ubiquitous support in endpoints, and provides for userspace implementation. Note that this effort follows from the SPUD BoF in Dallas and the SPUD prototyping effort, and preparation for the BoF has taken place on the SPUD list.

   - Tentative charter: 
        The PLUS working group's goal is to define a common shim layer atop the User
        Datagram Protocol (UDP) to provide a transport-independent method to signal
        flow semantics under transport and application control, necessary to enable
        the deployment of new, encrypted transport protocols within the existing
        Internet. UDP provides compatibility with currently deployed middleboxes as
        well as ubiquitous support in endpoints, and supports userspace implementation
        of new transport protocols. The working group will not specify any new
        transport protocols.

        The current Internet protocol stack does not provide explicit, in-band,
        transport-independent signaling to on-path network devices. This has led to
        the deployment of devices which perform implicit discovery of transport
        semantics and traffic characteristics via inspection of protocol headers and
        payload, a practice made possible when these are sent in the clear.

        In order to support more ubiquitous deployment of encryption, and the
        encryption of transport headers to allow deployment of new transport
        protocols, explicit in-band signaling must be added to the stack. This
        signaling must be transport protocol independent, and the types of information
        signaled must be based on characteristics that can be independently verified
        by devices on path, or that can be usefully applied without requiring a trust
        relationship between endpoints and the path. Further, a feedback channel that
        provides information from on-path devices back to endpoints and applications,
        e.g. for error handling, is essential for the deployment and success of an
        explicit cooperation approach.

        While IP would seem to be the natural home for this facility, both IPv4 and
        IPv6 options and extensions have deployment problems on their own, which makes
        it hard to include any additional information in these protocols.

        The PLUS working group will specify a new protocol as a Path Layer
        UDP Substrate (PLUS), to support experimental deployment of
        explicit cooperation between endpoints and devices on path, with the following goals:

        - enable ubiquitous deployment of encrypted higher layer protocols
          by providing exposure of basic TCP-like semantics (e.g. SYN, FIN, 
          RST flags) to devices on path (e.g. NATs and firewalls).

        - allow applications and transport protocols to explicitly provide
          limited information with integrity protection to devices on path

        - allow devices on path to provide unencrypted feedback and information 
          about the path directly to sending endpoints, under sending endpoint
          control

        - allow devices on path to provide unencrypted information about the 
          path to receiving endpoints, with encrypted feedback to the 
          sending endpoint, under sending endpoint control

        This approach explicitly gives the control of information exposure back the
        application and/or transport layer protocol on the end host. It is the goal of
        PLUS to minimize the information exposed, to make information exposure
        transparent, and to limit the level of detail to that useful for network
        treatment, while encrypting everything else. Endpoint verification of
        signaling integrity, careful design of minimal data structures, and
        restrictive policies for registration of signals can help to meet this goal.
        This is important to avoid future implicit treatment and resulting
        ossification, as well as to minimize the privacy risks presented by explicit
        cooperation.

        Given that the primary goal of PLUS is to enable the deployment of transport
        protocols with encrypted headers, we assume that the higher-layer protocol can
        provide an encryption context that can be used by PLUS to provide
        authentication, integrity, and encryption where needed. The primary threat
        model to defend against will be modification or deletion of exposed
        information by middleboxes and other devices on path, by allowing a remote
        endpoint to detect modifications.

        The working group will start with an initial set of use cases (see draft-
        kuehlewind-spud-use-cases) and requirements (see draft-trammell-spud-req),
        taken from experience with the Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams (SPUD)
        prototype. The working group's main output will be an experimental protocol
        specification, together with an initial registry of types of information that
        can be exposed using PLUS, clearly aligned to the use cases determined by the
        working group. The working group will close if it is not able to come to
        consensus on a protocol design to meet these requirements.

        The working group will additionally aim to identify and work with other
        working groups that could address parts of these requirements within existing
        protocols, e.g. by specifying new protocol extensions, or as input for on-
        going standardization work. It will aim to work with working groups defining
        encryption protocols (e.g. DTLS) which could be used for encryption of
        transport protocols running over PLUS.
