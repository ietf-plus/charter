This proposed working group will define a new Path Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS)
protocol, that supports in-band management of in-network state (e.g. on
firewalls and NAT boxes) in a transport-independent way. PLUS will, in effect,
provide a common "wire image" for new, encrypted transport protocols. PLUS is
intended to be deployed underneath encrypted transport protocols, which
protect the confidentiality of their payloads and most of their headers, and
can protect the integrity of those headers exposed to the network. Given
current deployment practices and the constraints they impose on deploying new
protocols, PLUS will be defined as a shim layer, on top of UDP and underneath
the actual transport protocol.

The clearest example of state management is taken from TCP. TCP's state
mechanics uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged in the
clear, such as SYN-SYNACK-ACK in the three-way handshake, but also FIN or RST
on connection shutdown.  Because these are visible to network elements on the
path between the endpoints to which the transport connection belongs, they are
often used as signals by those network elements. For transports that do not
exchange these messages in the clear, on-path network elements lack these
signals for their flow state management. Without these signals, stateful
network elements such as firewalls can only apply stricter policies for those
flows, such as shorter timeouts to remove flow state, or rules to drop this
unknown traffic completely. PLUS will provide a transport-independent way to
signal this information to on-path network devices, facilitating the
deployment of new, encrypted transport protocols.

In non-TCP specific terms, the most important of these signals concerns flow
lifetime and association of a uniflow with its reverse counterpart, by which
firewalls and other stateful network element assume endpoint consent to
communicate. A stop signal that indicates the last packet of a flow can also
assist stateful devices in their state management, and would allow for longer
timeouts for active flows, reducing the rate at which keep-alive traffic must
be sent to avoid loss of-on path state. Other signals currently exposed in
transport headers include information for implicit passive performance
measurement, such as loss, reordering, and round-trip-time calculation, as
provided in TCP by the sequence and acknowledgment numbers and the timestamp
option.

The working group's main output will be an experimental protocol
specification. This PLUS protocol specification will especially consider
potential attacks against the protocol, both arising from the encapsulation
chosen as well as new attacks made possible by the protocol, and propose
mitigations for these attacks. The primary threat model to defend against
will be modification or deletion of exposed information by middleboxes and
other devices on path, by allowing a remote endpoint to detect modifications.
    
The working group will aim to identify and work with other working groups that
could address its goals within existing protocols, e.g. by specifying new
protocol extensions, or as input for on-going standardization work. It will
aim to work with working groups defining transport protocols (e.g. QUIC) whose
development efforts could act as sources of requirements for PLUS, and which
could use PLUS to improve their deployability and interoperability with
stateful on-path devices.

Abstract mechanisms for state exposure and signaling will take draft-trammell-
plus-statefulness and draft-trammell-plus-abstract-mech as starting points.

The design and specification of new transport protocols or encryption schemes
running over PLUS will be out of scope for the working group. Signaling among
on-path devices for state management without endpoint visibility and consent,
whether in-band or out-of-band, will also be out of scope.
